Here is a small introduction to "Disruptive Innovation" posted at HBS Online, https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/what-is-disruptive-innovation   

Disruptive innovation is a term coined by Harvard Business School Professor Clayton Christensen. Many use ‘disruptive innovation’ to describe any situation in which an industry is shaken up and previously successful incumbents stumble, Christensen writes in the Harvard Business Review. But that’s much too broad a usage. In fact, the process of disruptive innovation is far more nuanced than that. You can find more details in the HBS blog and at the Christensen Institute, link: https://www.christenseninstitute.org/theory/disruptive-innovation/ 

I feel disruptive innovation needs a well thought approach and learning the right skills from the "Guru". Startups might find this useful as they can bring in newer products and services to a niche market segment, usually at a smaller price tag that can be affordable by a larger segment. Quantum AI, AGI and many more emerging technologies can help in this. These products can later be sold to big players for a nice price as an exit deal or during the merger and acquisition process.
