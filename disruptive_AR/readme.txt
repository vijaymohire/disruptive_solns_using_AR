This folder contain details for the disruptive applied research that we conduct that allows for the finding of an highly disruptive research project that generates various findings that can be revolutionary. The focus of the
AR is to find the best types of disruptive areas within the scoped technology. For example, disruptive AR project tries to search for the best candidate for a PQC algorithm that can provide better security for both classical and
quantum assets.
